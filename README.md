1st Python Homework Assignment


My code will check to see if the resource files are in the correct location before running completely.   So, make sure the same file structures exist for your test environment as they do with the homework folders.

My code was written in the "Instructions" folder.  Which means the following sub-directories must exists.  If they don't, my code will print a message to the console telling you the files don't exists where they are expected.

  <b>...\PyBank\Resources\budget_data.csv<br>
  ...\PyPoll\Resources\election_data.csv</b>


<b>My code produces 3 outputs:</b><br>
  <b>1</b> - Prints both results to the Console<br>
  <b>2</b> - Budget_Analysis_PHP.txt file in the root folder (formerly the "Instructions" folder)<br>
  <b>3</b> - Voting_Results_PHP.txt file in the root folder (formerly the "Instructions" folder)
